#### data
The Data come from [this website](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/), which is a repository with Amazon customer review data on different categories such as Baby, Beauty or Musical instruments. The data used in this notebook will be used to predict baby product satisfaction, and thus will generalize towards reviews oriented at this subject specifically.

#### Candidate machine learning methods?
Potential machine learning methods are logistic regression, ridge and lesso regression or methods such as backward predcitor selection
